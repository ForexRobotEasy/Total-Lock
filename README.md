Total Lock is a Forex Robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This expert advisor aims to minimize losses and maximize profits by utilizing a lock mechanism when the market moves against the trader.

## Description
The Total Lock Forex Robot is designed to automatically monitor the market for sharp moves against the trader's position. When such a move occurs, the robot places a counter order (lock) to freeze the loss and protect the trader's capital. Once the lock order is placed, the robot continuously checks if the lock order should be closed based on a predefined lock profit level.

## Features
- Locks losses to prevent further drawdown
- Monitors for sharp market moves against the trader
- Places counter orders (lock) to freeze losses
- Closes the lock order when a predefined lock profit level is reached

## How it Works
The Total Lock Forex Robot operates based on the following principles:

1. Initialization:
   - The robot enables trading.

2. OnTick:
   - The robot checks if a lock order is currently active.
   - If no lock order is active, it checks for a sharp market move against the trader.
   - If a sharp market move is detected, the robot places a lock order.
   - If a lock order is active, the robot checks if it should be closed based on the lock profit level.
   - If the lock order should be closed, it is closed, and the lock ticket is reset.

3. MarketMoveAgainstTrader:
   - Calculates the current loss.
   - Checks if the current loss exceeds the lock loss level.
   - Returns true if the current loss exceeds the lock loss level, indicating a sharp market move against the trader.

4. CalculateCurrentLoss:
   - Calculates the loss based on the current market price.
   - Converts the loss to pips.

5. PlaceLockOrder:
   - Calculates the lock order price based on the lock loss level.
   - Places the lock order with the calculated price and a take profit level.

6. ShouldCloseLockOrder:
   - Calculates the current profit.
   - Checks if the current profit exceeds the lock profit level.
   - Returns true if the current profit exceeds the lock profit level, indicating that the lock order should be closed.
